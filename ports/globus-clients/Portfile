description             Globus Toolkit - client collection
long_description        The Globus Toolkit is an open source software \
                        toolkit used for building Grid systems and \
                        applications. It is being developed by the \
                        Globus Alliance and many others all over the \
                        world. A growing number of projects and \
                        companies are using the Globus Toolkit to \
                        unlock the potential of grids for their \
                        cause. This package defines only the dependencies \
                        to include all the Globus client tools that \
                        are relevant to end users.
